        The resort complex falls under Trivandrum district and is 18 kilometres away from
        it, 22 kilometres from the airport. It is 20 kilometres away from the historic Vizhinjam
        (pronounced as Virinyam) harbour and 6 kilometres from Vizhinjam town. Surya Samudra
        began as a single octagonal stone house thirty miles from the tip of India and just
        a few minutes from the historic Vizhinjam harbour (pronounced as Virinyam) Today,
        it has grown into an eco-friendly beach resort with 23 houses spread over nearly
        one-third of an acre of private space and each house comes with a luxuriant foliage
        of coconut, palm, bamboo, banana, wild shrubs, flowers and the chirping of birds.
        Individual cottages or houses make up the resort, call bells at the door have been
        avoided since the sound is jarring and each house has a granite-topped table and
        stools cut from granite pillars where one can sit and watch the waves lash against
        the cliff throwing little water beads against the azure sky.<br />

        The Octopus, the resorts restaurant, specialises in and offers various sea-food
        ranging from lobsters and tiger prawns to octopus and shark; from barracuda puttu
        and sea urchins to baked crab and Japanese tuna. Local dishes (vegetables and fish)
        too are prepared and can be savoured on plantain leaves. With the exception of jam,
        cream and pickles no preserved food is used in the resort. Fresh fish from the sea,
        vegetables and fruits grown in the resort garden are used to avoid pollution in
        food materials Bread, cakes and ice creams are prepared here on a daily basis. Such
        is the taste of the preparations that a regular customer once made a long distance
        call just to ensure that she got banana cake and mango ice-cream when she would
        visit them shortly!
