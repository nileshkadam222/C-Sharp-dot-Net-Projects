            dating back almost to the foundation of the State. We are continuing to build on
            that tradition of public service and transport expertise to give <span class="SpellE">
                Kerala</span> a bus and coach system of which we can be justly proud of. </span>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana">The prime essentiality, the prompt methodology and
