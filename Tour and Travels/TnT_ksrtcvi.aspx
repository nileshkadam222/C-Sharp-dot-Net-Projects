        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt">We have inherited
            a proud tradition of public service dating back almost to the foundation of the
            State. We are continuing to build on that tradition of public service and transport
            expertise to give <span class="SpellE">Kerala</span> a bus and coach system of which
            we can be justly proud of. <span>The prime essentiality, the prompt methodology and
                the ship shape vigour of KSRTC is why our dedicated public has betrothed to our
                service. </span></span></span></span></span>

        <span><span style="font-size: 12pt">The history of <span class="SpellE">Kerala</span>
            State Road Transport Corporation began whilst the development of <span class="GramE">
                the it</span> wasn't booming enough like today. The <span class="SpellE">Travancore</span>
            State Transport Department was constituted by the erstwhile <span class="SpellE">Travancore</span>
            Government with a view to reorganize the transport service of the state. <span class="SpellE">
                Mr</span> E.G. Salter, Assistant, Operating <span class="SpellE">Supdt</span>
            of London Passenger Transport Board was appointed as <span class="SpellE">Supdt</span>

            <span>and the staff had built the body under the supervision of <span class="SpellE">
                Mr</span> Salter himself. The selection of operating staff remains as a model which
                has been followed by the present staff as well. Those who were likely to lose their
                jobs in the private sectors due to the nationalization of <span class="SpellE">Thiruvanathapuram</span>
                <span class="SpellE">Kanyakumari</span> route were given preference for appointment
                in the new department. Nearly a hundred Bachelor degree holders were given <span
